The goal of this project is to recreate an 8-bit Simple RISC Machine I designed for a school project using Verilog. I have purposely left out the code for some components, like resisters with a Load Enable feature (vDFFE), to avoid academic misconduct. I have also kept the Testbenches I used private. 

# Design 

The schematic for the computer can be seen in ```Design.png``` which I borrowed from the lab manual we were given.

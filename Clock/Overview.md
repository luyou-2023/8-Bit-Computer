# Clock Module 

The clock module serves to synchronize the entire computer. The design is based around three 555 timers in astable, monostable and bistable configurations. The clock has a 2Hz frequncy at the moment and a manual pulse option for debugging. The clock rate is adjustable and I will probably use a 1 Mega Ohm potentiometer in the future to vary the speed. There are of course, many ways to design a clock. Designing it this way certainly has given me a deeper apreciation for the GHz clock rates of today.

# 8-Bit-Computer
8-Bit Breadboard Computer built from basic logic gates. I will be buliding the computer based on a project I completed individually in my second year (see 
```\Verilog\ Designs```) as well as an online tutorial by Ben Eater: https://eater.net/8bit/. 

Ideally, I would build the entire computer (except possibly the memory) using only NAND gates. However, I am a busy student and time and money are limited resources. Not to mention, quality breadboards are by far the most expensive components in this project and building all the modules out of nand gates would use an absurd amount of breadboards. 

With this in mind, I have choosen to first design modules out of the basic gates I had at hand for one or two bits, then use an IC for the 8-bit versions. I hope to really get a feeling for computer architecture by doing it this way. I have documented both versions. 

As this project is still in progress, the most immediate goal is to finish the individual modules and get them to work together. In the future I would like to expand the ISA adding support for more instructions and memory.
